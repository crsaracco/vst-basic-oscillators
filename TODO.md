# TODO

### Organization

 - Figure out a way to organize these five different oscillators
 - Split up the actual oscillators from the VST drivers of the oscillators

### Basic waveform oscillators

Create a simple monophonic oscillator for each of these waveforms:

 - ~~Sine wave~~
 - Sawtooth wave (additive synthesis)
 - Square wave (additive synthesis)
 - Triangle wave (additive synthesis)
 - Semisine wave (additive synthesis)

### Add polyphony to all of the oscillators

 - Sine wave
 - Sawtooth wave
 - Square wave
 - Triangle wave
 - Semisine wave

### Add velocity handling to all of the oscillators

 - Sine wave
 - Sawtooth wave
 - Square wave
 - Triangle wave
 - Semisine wave
